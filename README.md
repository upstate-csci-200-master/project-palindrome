write a Java program to determine if a string is a palindrome using StringBuilder's reverse function and an "if" statement to compare; we will discuss this in class; I will also provide starting code to help you with the if statement

C - input a string and output: radar is a palindrome or hello is not a palindrome

B - handle upper and lower case characters as the same; so RAdar would be considered a palindrome (think about String methods discussed in chapter 3; here's an excellent resource - https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp)

A - handle dates in the format mm/dd/yyyy (there are methods in the string class to help you with this)

extra credit - given 2 dates output all the dates in that range which are palindromes

Here's what's in this repository

> ReverseString.java - java program that demonstrates how to use the StringBuilder class to reverse a string

> Program2.java - this is your starting code file; it contains everything you need and is where you will place your code

> NOTE: there is only ONE source code file for this assignment

> testC.txt - test file for C version

> testC.out - expected output for testC.txt

> testB.txt - test file for B version

> testB.out - expected output for testB.txt

> testA.txt - test file for A version

> testA.out - expected output for A version
