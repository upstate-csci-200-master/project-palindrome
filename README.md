# program-2
write a Java program to determine if a string is a palindrome using StringBuilder's reverse function and an "if" statement to compare; we will discuss this in class; I will also provide starting code to help you with the if statement

C - input a string and output: radar is a palindrome or hello is not a palindrome

B - handle upper and lower case characters as the same; so RAdar would be considered a palindrome (think about String methods discussed in chapter 3; here's an excellent resource - https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp)

A - handle dates in the format mm/dd/yyyy (there are methods in the string class to help you with this)

extra credit - given 2 dates output all the dates in that range which are palindromes
