# Project - Palindrome
Write a Java program to determine if a string is a palindrome using StringBuilder's reverse function and an "if" statement to compare. We will discuss this in a video. I am providing starting code to help you with the if statement. The program will call your isPalindrome method each time it reads a word until it encounters the word QUIT.

C - input a string and output if it is an palindrome or not
example input
```
radar
hello
12321
12345
x
QUIT
```
example output
```
the string [radar] IS a palindrome
the string [hello] IS NOT a palindrome
the string [12321] IS a palindrome
the string [12345] IS NOT a palindrome
the string [x] IS a palindrome
```

B - handle upper and lower case characters as the same; so RAdar would be considered a palindrome (think about String methods discussed in chapter 3; here's an excellent resource - https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp)

A - ignore spaces and punctuation so that a string such as: "A nut for a jar of tuna." is seen as a palindrome; this can be done using some String methods

Here's what's in this repository

> ReverseString.java - java program that demonstrates how to use the StringBuilder class to reverse a string

> Palindrome.java - this is your starting code file; it contains everything you need and is where you will place your code

> NOTE: there is only ONE source code file for this assignment

> testC.txt - test file for C version

> testC.out - expected output for testC.txt

> testB.txt - test file for B version

> testB.out - expected output for testB.txt

> testA.txt - test file for A version

> testA.out - expected output for A version
